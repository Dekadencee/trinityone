## Introduction

TrinityOne is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is a fork from *TrinityCore*, which was originally deprived of *MaNGOS*,
the *Massive Network Game Object Server*. It is based on the code of former mentioned
project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase
as well as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.

As of September 2013, it's in a highly active state of reversal and optimization,
thus expect a lot of changes to the code API and environment.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
